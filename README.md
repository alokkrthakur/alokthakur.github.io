### Characterization of built environment
•	Critically reviews the research on the measurement, modeling, and mitigation (3Ms) of IAP in developed nations and India
•	Lack of state-of-the-art instrumentation for comprehensive characterization, reporting a limited number of pollutants, etc., to be a few bottlenecks in existing indoor studies
•	Fundamental studies on sources, transport, transformation, and the fate of pollutants in urban indoor spaces are nearly non-existent
•	Few recommendations, like proper resource allotment to IAP studies, devising regulatory guidelines, etc., to be a few initial steps for better IAP research
